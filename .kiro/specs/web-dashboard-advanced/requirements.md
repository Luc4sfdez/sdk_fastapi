# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for an advanced web dashboard for the FastAPI Microservices SDK. The current web interface provides basic service creation functionality, but lacks comprehensive management, monitoring, and operational capabilities. This advanced dashboard will transform the SDK into a complete web-based platform for microservices lifecycle management, providing developers with real-time insights, deployment capabilities, and comprehensive service management tools.

The advanced dashboard will serve as the central hub for developers to create, monitor, deploy, and manage their microservices ecosystem through an intuitive web interface, eliminating the need to rely solely on CLI commands for advanced operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive service management interface, so that I can view, monitor, and manage all my created microservices from a single dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the services management page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all created services with their current status
2. WHEN I view a service in the list THEN the system SHALL show service name, template type, creation date, port, and health status
3. WHEN I click on a service THEN the system SHALL navigate to a detailed service view with full configuration and metrics
4. WHEN a service is running THEN the system SHALL display a green "Running" status indicator
5. WHEN a service is stopped THEN the system SHALL display a red "Stopped" status indicator
6. WHEN I want to start/stop a service THEN the system SHALL provide action buttons to control service lifecycle

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time monitoring and metrics visualization, so that I can track the performance and health of my microservices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time metrics for all running services
2. WHEN viewing service metrics THEN the system SHALL show CPU usage, memory consumption, request count, and response times
3. WHEN metrics data is available THEN the system SHALL render interactive charts and graphs using Chart.js or similar
4. WHEN a service experiences issues THEN the system SHALL highlight alerts and warnings prominently
5. WHEN I select a time range THEN the system SHALL filter metrics data accordingly (last hour, day, week)
6. WHEN viewing detailed metrics THEN the system SHALL provide drill-down capabilities for specific endpoints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deployment management capabilities, so that I can deploy my services to different environments directly from the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the deployment section THEN the system SHALL show available deployment targets (Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud)
2. WHEN I select a service for deployment THEN the system SHALL provide environment-specific configuration options
3. WHEN I initiate a deployment THEN the system SHALL show real-time deployment progress and logs
4. WHEN deployment completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display deployment status and access URLs
5. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL show detailed error messages and suggested fixes
6. WHEN I want to rollback THEN the system SHALL provide one-click rollback functionality for previous deployments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration management through the web interface, so that I can modify service settings without editing files manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access service configuration THEN the system SHALL display all configurable parameters in a user-friendly form
2. WHEN I modify configuration values THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and show immediate feedback
3. WHEN I save configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply changes and restart the service if necessary
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and highlight specific errors
5. WHEN I want to revert changes THEN the system SHALL provide a reset to defaults option
6. WHEN viewing configuration history THEN the system SHALL show previous versions with timestamps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want log management and viewing capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor service behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access service logs THEN the system SHALL display real-time log streaming with automatic updates
2. WHEN viewing logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
3. WHEN I search logs THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text and provide search navigation
4. WHEN logs are extensive THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtual scrolling for performance
5. WHEN I want to download logs THEN the system SHALL provide export functionality in multiple formats
6. WHEN viewing logs THEN the system SHALL color-code different log levels for better readability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API documentation integration, so that I can view and test service endpoints directly from the dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access API documentation THEN the system SHALL display interactive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for each service
2. WHEN viewing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL show request/response schemas, parameters, and examples
3. WHEN I want to test an endpoint THEN the system SHALL provide a built-in API testing interface
4. WHEN testing APIs THEN the system SHALL show request/response details and execution time
5. WHEN API documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the displayed documentation
6. WHEN viewing multiple services THEN the system SHALL provide easy navigation between different API documentations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want template management capabilities, so that I can create, modify, and share custom service templates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access template management THEN the system SHALL display all available templates with their details
2. WHEN I want to create a custom template THEN the system SHALL provide a template editor with syntax highlighting
3. WHEN I modify a template THEN the system SHALL validate template syntax and variable usage
4. WHEN I save a template THEN the system SHALL make it available for service creation immediately
5. WHEN I want to share templates THEN the system SHALL provide export/import functionality
6. WHEN viewing template details THEN the system SHALL show usage statistics and generated services count

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want system health and diagnostics, so that I can ensure the SDK and all services are operating correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access system diagnostics THEN the system SHALL display overall SDK health status
2. WHEN viewing system metrics THEN the system SHALL show resource usage, active services count, and system uptime
3. WHEN there are system issues THEN the system SHALL display alerts with recommended actions
4. WHEN I run diagnostics THEN the system SHALL perform health checks on all components and report results
5. WHEN viewing service dependencies THEN the system SHALL show service interconnections and dependency health
6. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL warn about potential performance impacts
