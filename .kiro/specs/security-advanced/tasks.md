## Implementation Notes

### Security-First Development Principles
- **Fail Secure**: All security components default to most restrictive policy on failure
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers with independent validation
- **Zero Trust**: Every request validated at every security layer
- **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary permissions granted at each level

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each security component tested in isolation with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: Security layer interaction and end-to-end flows
- **Security Tests**: Penetration testing and attack simulation
- **Performance Tests**: Security overhead and scalability validation

### Implementation Order
The tasks are ordered to build security foundation first, then add layers incrementally:
1. **Foundation** (Tasks 1.x): Configuration, logging, exceptions
2. **Transport Security** (Tasks 2.x, 3.x): Certificates and mTLS
3. **Access Control** (Tasks 4.x, 5.x): RBAC and ABAC
4. **Monitoring** (Tasks 6.x): Threat detection and response
5. **Integration** (Tasks 7.x): Unified security stack
6. **Validation** (Tasks 8.x): Comprehensive testing

Each task builds upon previous tasks and includes comprehensive testing to ensure security correctness and performance requirements are met.
