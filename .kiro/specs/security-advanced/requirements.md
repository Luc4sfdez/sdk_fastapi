# Requirements Document - Sprint Security 2: Advanced Security

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing advanced security features in the FastAPI Microservices SDK. Building upon the foundation of Sprint Security 1 (JWT, Secrets Management, Input Validation, Rate Limiting, CORS), Sprint Security 2 will add enterprise-grade security capabilities including mTLS, RBAC/ABAC, Security Logging, Certificate Management, and Threat Detection.

The goal is to provide military-grade security suitable for highly regulated environments such as financial services, healthcare, government, and enterprise applications requiring the highest security standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mutual TLS (mTLS) Communication

**User Story:** As a security architect, I want mutual TLS authentication between all microservices, so that I can ensure encrypted and authenticated communication with zero-trust networking principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service initiates communication with another service THEN the system SHALL establish mTLS connection with mutual certificate verification
2. WHEN certificate validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the connection and log the security event
3. WHEN certificates are near expiration THEN the system SHALL automatically rotate certificates without service interruption
4. IF mTLS is enabled THEN the system SHALL reject all non-mTLS connections
5. WHEN mTLS handshake completes THEN the system SHALL verify certificate chain, validity period, and revocation status
6. WHEN service starts THEN the system SHALL load client and server certificates from secure storage
7. IF certificate loading fails THEN the system SHALL fail to start with clear error message

### Requirement 2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want fine-grained role-based access control, so that I can manage user permissions and service access based on organizational roles and responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user or service requests access THEN the system SHALL verify their assigned roles against required permissions
2. WHEN roles are assigned THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical role inheritance (admin > manager > user)
3. WHEN permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL evaluate role-based permissions in real-time
4. IF user lacks required role THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the authorization attempt
5. WHEN roles change THEN the system SHALL immediately apply new permissions without requiring re-authentication
6. WHEN service calls endpoint THEN the system SHALL verify service has required role for that operation
7. IF role configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the configuration with validation errors

### Requirement 3: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want attribute-based access control with contextual policies, so that I can implement complex access rules based on user attributes, resource properties, and environmental conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access is requested THEN the system SHALL evaluate user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental context
2. WHEN policy rules are defined THEN the system SHALL support complex boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) in access policies
3. WHEN context changes THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate access permissions dynamically
4. IF policy evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL deny access and provide detailed policy violation information
5. WHEN attributes are missing THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with configurable default behavior
6. WHEN policies conflict THEN the system SHALL apply precedence rules (deny-by-default, explicit deny overrides allow)
7. IF policy syntax is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject policy with clear validation errors

### Requirement 4: Security Logging and Auditing

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want comprehensive security logging and auditing, so that I can monitor, investigate, and respond to security events and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log events in structured format (JSON) with standardized fields
2. WHEN authentication attempts happen THEN the system SHALL log success/failure with user identity, timestamp, and source IP
3. WHEN authorization decisions are made THEN the system SHALL log access grants/denials with policy details
4. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL generate high-priority security alerts
5. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL include correlation IDs for request tracing
6. WHEN log storage reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL rotate logs automatically with configurable retention
7. IF log tampering is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and preserve evidence

### Requirement 5: Certificate Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated certificate management, so that I can ensure certificates are always valid, properly rotated, and securely stored without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN certificates are near expiration THEN the system SHALL automatically request renewal from Certificate Authority
2. WHEN new certificates are issued THEN the system SHALL validate certificate chain and install securely
3. WHEN certificate rotation occurs THEN the system SHALL update all services without downtime
4. IF certificate validation fails THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and maintain current valid certificates
5. WHEN certificates are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure storage with encryption at rest
6. WHEN certificate status changes THEN the system SHALL update certificate revocation lists (CRL)
7. IF CA communication fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and alert on persistent failures

### Requirement 6: Threat Detection

**User Story:** As a security operations center analyst, I want basic threat detection capabilities, so that I can identify and respond to potential security threats in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple failed authentication attempts occur THEN the system SHALL detect brute force attacks and trigger countermeasures
2. WHEN unusual access patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL flag potential insider threats or compromised accounts
3. WHEN known attack signatures are identified THEN the system SHALL block requests and alert security team
4. IF rate limiting thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL escalate to threat detection for analysis
5. WHEN geographic anomalies occur THEN the system SHALL detect impossible travel and suspicious locations
6. WHEN privilege escalation attempts happen THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent unauthorized elevation
7. IF threat confidence exceeds threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically implement protective measures

### Requirement 7: Security Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want centralized security configuration management, so that I can maintain consistent security policies across all microservices and environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security policies are updated THEN the system SHALL propagate changes to all affected services
2. WHEN configuration validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify policy syntax and logical consistency
3. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL load latest security configuration from central store
4. IF configuration is corrupted THEN the system SHALL fall back to last known good configuration
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail of all modifications
6. WHEN policy conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL resolve using precedence rules and alert administrators
7. IF configuration service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL operate with cached configuration and alert on staleness

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Security

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with existing security features, so that advanced security works together with JWT authentication, secrets management, and input validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mTLS is enabled THEN the system SHALL continue to support JWT authentication for application-level authorization
2. WHEN RBAC/ABAC is active THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing rate limiting for policy-based throttling
3. WHEN security logging runs THEN the system SHALL capture events from all security components (JWT, secrets, validation)
4. IF multiple security layers conflict THEN the system SHALL apply most restrictive policy and log the decision
5. WHEN certificates are managed THEN the system SHALL integrate with secrets management for secure storage
6. WHEN threat detection activates THEN the system SHALL coordinate with existing input validation and CORS policies
7. IF security components fail THEN the system SHALL maintain defense-in-depth with remaining security layers
