# Requirements Document - Sprint Observability

## Introduction

The Observability Sprint aims to implement a comprehensive observability stack for the FastAPI Microservices SDK, providing complete visibility into system behavior, performance, and health in production environments. This sprint will deliver enterprise-grade monitoring, distributed tracing, advanced logging, and alerting capabilities that are essential for operating microservices at scale.

The observability system will integrate seamlessly with the existing Security, Communication, and Database components, providing unified visibility across all SDK functionalities while maintaining high performance and minimal overhead.
